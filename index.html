            From Africa to the Indus: The Epic Journey of Modern Humans in South Asia:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1]
            The earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Sedentariness began in South Asia
            around 7000 BCE; by 4500 BCE, settled life had spread,[2] and gradually evolved into the Indus Valley
            Civilisation, one of three early cradles of civilisation in the Old World,[3][4] which flourished between
            2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and north-western India. Early in the second millennium BCE,
            persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban centres to
            villages. Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration. The Vedic
            Period of the Vedic people in northern India (1500‚Äì500 BCE) was marked by the composition of their extensive
            collections of hymns (Vedas). The social structure was loosely stratified via the varna system, incorporated
            into the highly evolved present-day JƒÅti system. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab
            into the Gangetic plain. Around 600 BCE, a new, interregional culture arose; then, small chieftaincies
            (janapadas) were consolidated into larger states (mahajanapadas). Second urbanization took place, which came
            with the rise of new ascetic movements and religious concepts,[5] including the rise of Jainism and
            Buddhism. The latter was synthesized with the preexisting religious cultures of the subcontinent, giving
            rise to Hinduism.

            Maurya to Gupta: Power, Peace & the Golden Age of India:
        </h2>
        <P>
            Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the
            Maurya Empire. India's Mauryan king Ashoka is widely recognised for the violent kalinga war and his
            historical acceptance of Buddhism and his attempts to spread nonviolence and peace across his empire. The
            Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general
            Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would form the Shunga Empire in the north and north-east of the subcontinent,
            while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the north-west and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts
            of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This
            period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence is known as the Classical or Golden Age of
            India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which
            led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.[6][5] The most
            significant event between the 7th and 11th centuries was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj.
            Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century. The Chola
            dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century. In the early medieval period, Indian mathematics,
            including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world,
            including the creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.[7]

            South Asian Stone Age:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hominin expansion from Africa is estimated to have reached the Indian subcontinent approximately two million
            years ago, and possibly as early as 2.2 million years ago.[26][27][28] This dating is based on the known
            presence of Homo erectus in Indonesia by 1.8 million years ago and in East Asia by 1.36 million years ago,
            as well as the discovery of stone tools at Riwat in Pakistan.[27][29] Although some older discoveries have
            been claimed, the suggested dates, based on the dating of fluvial sediments, have not been independently
            verified.[28][30]

            The oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of Homo erectus or Homo
            heidelbergensis, from the Narmada Valley in central India, and are dated to approximately half a million
            years ago.[27][30] Older fossil finds have been claimed, but are considered unreliable.[30] Reviews of
            archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent by hominins was sporadic
            until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by approximately 250,000 years ago.

        <h3>
            According to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Modern human beings‚ÄîHomo sapiens‚Äîoriginated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and
            80,000 years ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems
            likely that initially they came by way of the coast. It is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in
            the subcontinent 55,000 years ago, even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to
            only about 30,000 years before the present.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            According to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonisation of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa.
            ... Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73‚Äì55 ka.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            Historian of South Asia, Michael H. Fisher, states:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the
            Arabian Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there
            may have been prior unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever
            further in each generation, spreading into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along
            the warm and productive coastal lands of the Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various
            bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000 years ago. <br>
            Archaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of anatomically modern humans in the
            Indian subcontinent 78,000‚Äì74,000 years ago,[34] although this interpretation is disputed.[35][36] The
            occupation of South Asia by modern humans, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has
            turned it into a highly diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            According to Tim Dyson:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent's people in other
            respects. In particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only
            Africa's population is genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of 'founder'
            events in the subcontinent. By this is meant circumstances where a subgroup‚Äîsuch as a tribe‚Äîderives from a
            tiny number of 'original' individuals. Further, compared to most world regions, the subcontinent's people
            are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high levels of endogamy.

            Neolithic:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus River alluvium approximately
            9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[2][39]
            According to Tim Dyson: "By 7,000 years ago agriculture was firmly established in Baluchistan... [and]
            slowly spread eastwards into the Indus valley."

        <h3>
            Michael Fisher adds:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The earliest discovered instance ... of well-established, settled agricultural society is at Mehrgarh in the
            hills between the Bolan Pass and the Indus plain (today in Pakistan) (see Map 3.1). From as early as 7000
            BCE, communities there started investing increased labor in preparing the land and selecting, planting,
            tending, and harvesting particular grain-producing plants. They also domesticated animals, including sheep,
            goats, pigs, and oxen (both humped zebu [Bos indicus] and unhumped [Bos taurus]). Castrating oxen, for
            instance, turned them from mainly meat sources into domesticated draft-animals as well.

            Indus Valley Civilisation:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300 BCE.[citation needed] The Indus Valley region
            was one of three early cradles of civilisation in the Old World; the Indus Valley civilisation was the most
            expansive,[3] and at its peak, may have had a population of over five million. <br>
            The civilisation was primarily centred in modern-day Pakistan, in the Indus river basin, and secondarily in
            the Ghaggar-Hakra River basin. The mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking
            the beginning of urban civilisation on the Indian subcontinent. It included cities such as Harappa,
            Ganweriwal, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in
            modern-day India. <br>
            Inhabitants of the ancient Indus River valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and
            handicraft, and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin.[42] The civilisation is noted for its cities built
            of brick, and its roadside drainage systems, and is thought to have had some kind of municipal organisation.
            The civilisation also developed an Indus script, the earliest of the ancient Indian scripts, which is
            presently undeciphered.[43] This is the reason why Harappan language is not directly attested, and its
            affiliation is uncertain. <br>
            After the collapse of Indus Valley civilisation, the inhabitants migrated from the river valleys of Indus
            and Ghaggar-Hakra, towards the Himalayan foothills of Ganga-Yamuna basin.

        <p>
            During the 2nd millennium BCE, Ochre Coloured Pottery culture was in Ganga Yamuna Doab region. These were
            rural settlements with agriculture and hunting. They were using copper tools such as axes, spears, arrows,
            and swords, and had domesticated animals.
